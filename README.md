Coperacha is a React Native app which make crowdfunding easy, borderless, and fee-free for you and your community. It is built on the Celo blockchain. 

Celo is a mobile-first blockchain. It is a fork of Ethereum and is built to be a global payments infrastructure targeting the developing world. Celo has two native cryptocurrencies, cUSD (a currency that's pegged to the Dollar, 1 cUSD = 1 USD) and Celo gold (a volatile currency used for Celo governance and utility). 

This app uses cUSD exclusively, and **requires a [Celo test wallet](https://celo.org/developers/wallet) in order to work** 


Check out the latest [Expo build here](https://expo.io/@alex243/projects/coperacha) (requires the Expo Go app). Currently Coperacha has only been tested on iOS.

**Note: Coperacha is in active development and is in an unfinished state. It only accepts test cUSD and runs on the Celo test network. Many things will not work or will not look great. Expect bugs!**
